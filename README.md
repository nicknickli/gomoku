==================================

This is Gomoku, otherwise known as Five-In-A-Row, in Python! I made this project for two reasons. I wanted to create a simple game to test my coding skills and I also wanted to create an AI to see if it can learn a simple game. I'm using Tkinter for the game UI to keep things simple since I really want to explore the core mechanics of the game.
